Personal Templated i used for put custom objects for rain world without using any depedences (so not fisobs here)

This is an alpha version still, but his custom edible works with his dev tool interfaze, so you can put them in your room there.

Later i will imprive this template to add more comments and more examples of differents type of objects

NOTE: At least the Room_Loader hooks works, i still want to improve, so welcome any suggestions

Push Request are welcome, also if you want some especific example or help me with this templace, you can dm me in discord (@skq_rw)

I want to give my thanks rot the Happy Astronaut (anubisrah), who is the author of the first version of the template and help me a lot before watcher update
And the modding comunity of rain world for help me wth some question in the discords channels :3. (Big orz to alphappy)

Have a nice cycle ðŸ¥³
